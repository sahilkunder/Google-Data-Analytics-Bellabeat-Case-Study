# Google-Data-Analytics-Bellabeat-Case-Study
## Introduction ##
This is an optional case study provided by Google as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. This particular case study involves preforming real-world tasks as a junior data analyst in order to answer the key business questions.

## Scenario ##
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

## Background ##
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women. Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices.

To answer the key business questions, I broke down the data analysis process into six key stages: **Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share** and **Act**, as taught in the Google Analytics Course.

### Tools used ###
- **Python** for data cleaningm validation and analyis.
- **Python** and **Tableau** for data visualization.
